    "text": "The sensors from Fine Offset are re-branded and partly modified by the resellers. This article deals with sensors from froggit (German Shop) and ecowitt (US shop). More precise the DP-/GW SmartHubs WiFi Gateway with temperature,humidity & Pressure which is developed by fine offset.\nThe unique selling point of the LoRa-Wifi gateway is the extraordinarily extensive possibility of connecting radio-bound sensors. Currently, depending on the gateway,\na maximum of 8 sensors can be connected:\n\nDP150/WN51 soil temperature sensors,\nDP50/WH31 multi channel temperature and humidity sensors\nWN34 wire probe thermometer\nDP10/WN35 leaf wetness sensors\nDP100 soil moisture sensors;\n\na maximum of 4:\n\nDP200/WH41/WH43 PM2.5/PM10 sensors\nWH45 Water leak sensors\n\na maximum of 2:\n\nDP250/WH45 CO2 / PM2.5 / PM10 / temperatur / moisture sensor\nDP60/WH57 Lightning sensor\n\nFor the basic weather parameters as rain, wind vector insolation temperature and humidity one of the compatible outdoor basis units as the DP1100 or WH3000"

    "section": "Calibration Concept",
    "text": "Calibration Concept\nThe low budget sensors are usually lacking of a stable measurement quality. To obtain reliable micro climate data a two step calibration process is implemented. In a first step the measurements of all sensors will be statistically analysed to identify sensor which produce outliers. In a second step the sensors are calibrated against an operational running high price reference station in the field.\nFor the future a machine learning approach including the radiation, azimuth, temperature and humidity as predictors for the calibrated temperature as the response variable will be used as an rolling calibration tool."
