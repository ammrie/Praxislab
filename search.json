This article deals with sensors from the german re-seller froggit and the US re-seller ecowitt. More precise the DP-/GW SmartHubs WiFi Gateway with temperature, humidity & Pressure which is developed by fine offset. The unique selling point of the LoRa-Wifi gateway is the extraordinarily extensive possibility of connecting radio-bound sensors."

To obtain reliable micro climate data a two step calibration process is suggested.\n\nIn a first step the measurements of all sensors will be statistically analysed to identify sensor which produce outliers.\nIn a second step the sensors are calibrated against an operational running high price reference station in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Calibration Plans\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the future a machine learning approach including the radiation, azimuth, temperature and humidity as predictors for the calibrated temperature as the response variable will be used as an rolling calibration tool."
