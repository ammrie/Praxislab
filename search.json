    "text": "Introduction\nThe sensors from Fine Offset are re-branded and partly modified by the resellers. We currently use sensors from froggit DP-series and ecowitt GW-1000/1500 series.\nThe currently used sensors are from Fine Offset Electronics which are identical in construction with the froggit as the so-called DP series and from ecowitt with the original series identification GW-1000."

    "text": "Currently 5 WiFi Hubs with 8 sensors and one base station each are connected via via LoRa radio. The base station is equipped with wind vector, precipitation irradiance and temperature/humidity sensors. The WiFi Hub in turn uses any accessible WLAN to pass on the data in this case via mobile network to a data server.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency: 868Mhz\nAir temperature range: -10°C to +60°C, resolution: 0.1°C, accuracy: +/- 1°C\nAir humidity range: 10% - 99%, Resolution: 1%, accuracy: +/- 5%.\nAir pressure range: 300-1100hPa, resolution: 0.1 hPa, accuracy: +/- 5hPa\nPower supply: USB 5V\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency: 868Mhz\nAir temperature range: -10°C to +60°C, resolution: 0.1.°C, accuracy: +/- 1°C\nAir humidity range: 10% - 99%, resolution: 1%, accuracy: +/- 5%.\nTransmission interval: 48 seconds\nPower supply: 2 x 1.5V AA batteries\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency: 868Mhz\nTemperature range: -40°C to +60°C, accuracy: +/- 1°C\nAir humidity range: 10% - 99%, accuracy: +/- 5%\nPrecipitation: range 0-9999mm, resolution +/- 0.25mm, accuracy: +/- 10%\nWind speed: 0-50m/s, accuracy: +/- 3.5 km/h or 10%\nWind speed/gust calculation every 16 s\nWind direction accuracy: +/- 1°\nUVI: range: 0 - 15 index, UV accuracy: +/- 15%\nSolar radiation: range 0 - 200k Lux, accuracy +/- 15%\nMeasuring interval outdoor unit: 16 seconds\nPower supply: Outdoor unit: 2 x 1.5V AA batteries. The primary energy source is the solar panel. The batteries provide backup power when solar energy is limited.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low budget sensors are usually lacking of a stable measurement quality. To obtain reliable micro climate data a two step calibration process is implemented. In a first step the measurements of all sensors will be statistically analysed to identify sensor which produce outliers. In a second step the sensors are calibrated against an operational running high price reference station in the field.\nFor the future a machine learning approach including the radiation, azimuth, temperature and humidity as predictors for the calibrated temperature as the response variable will be used as an rolling calibration tool."
